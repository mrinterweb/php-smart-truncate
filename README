This is a quick PHP string truncator that truncates based on actual pixels for rendered fonts.

If you have ever tried to truncate strings with non-monospaced fonts, you will know why I cooked up this class.

The following two lines render at aproximately the same width with Arial 10 pixel font:
"iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii iiiii"
"MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM MMM"

This truncator uses PHP's GD Library imagettfbbox to do its magic.
With GD version 1,  the size argument is in PIXELS for imagettfbbox.
With GD version 2+, the size argument is in POINTS for imagettfbbox.

You can ensure GD is installed on your machine by typing
php -m
Look for GD in the result of this command.

I have done a decent amount of benchmarking and performance optimizations to make this run fairly fast despite using GD's imagettfbox.
test.php can help you benchmark and test the class.
system_test.php can help you troubleshoot your environment.

IMPORTANT NOTE!  You will need to use your own TrueType fonts.  I have excluded these fonts because they are released under a different license.


Here are some ways to get msttcorefonts

Ubuntu:
apt-get install msttcorefonts

http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/

All you really need is the font you are trying to truncate with (example: Arial.ttf).


Usage Example:

<?php

require './smart_truncate.php';

$width = 185; // width in pixels
$points = 7.5; // depending on the size of your font convert font size to points. example: 10 pixels == 7.5 points
$font = './Arial.ttf'; // using absolute paths to your font file is preferred

$long_string = "This is a test of a long string that has no real purpose that I am just typing.";

$st = new SmartTruncate($font, $points, $width);
echo $st->truncate($long_string, '&hellip;'); // &hellip; => '...'

?>

More notes to come.
